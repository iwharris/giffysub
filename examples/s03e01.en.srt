1
00:00:01,782 --> 00:00:03,666
Giddyup, giddyup!

2
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:04,884
Meet Leslie Knope.

3
00:00:04,952 --> 00:00:06,152
Whap!

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,520
I am the pants queen!

5
00:00:07,588 --> 00:00:09,172
Leslie loves whipped cream,

6
00:00:09,256 --> 00:00:10,557
dancing with friends,

7
00:00:10,624 --> 00:00:12,425
and working hard
for the Parks Department

8
00:00:12,476 --> 00:00:13,510
of Pawnee, Indiana.

9
00:00:13,577 --> 00:00:14,794
Cut it out, Tom.

10
00:00:14,862 --> 00:00:15,812
It never gets old.

11
00:00:15,896 --> 00:00:16,980
She also loves her coworkers

12
00:00:17,047 --> 00:00:18,348
at City Hall,

13
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:21,100
Ron Swanson...

14
00:00:21,152 --> 00:00:22,402
Tom Haverford...

15
00:00:24,605 --> 00:00:25,522
Tommy Timberlake.

16
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:26,656
April Ludgate...

17
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,408
My mom's Puerto Rican.

18
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:30,443
That's why I'm so lively
and colorful.

19
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:32,695
And Andy Dwyer.

20
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,847
Uh-oh.

21
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:35,081
Nailed it.

22
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:37,417
April and Andy like each other.

23
00:00:37,484 --> 00:00:39,018
But Andy accidentally kissed

24
00:00:39,086 --> 00:00:40,954
his ex-girlfriend,
Ann Perkins...

25
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:42,088
Ooh.

26
00:00:42,155 --> 00:00:44,374
- April left.
- April!

27
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:45,592
And he hasn't seen her since.

28
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:47,260
In the midst of all this love,

29
00:00:47,328 --> 00:00:49,629
two black hats rode
into town...

30
00:00:49,697 --> 00:00:51,231
Scientists believe
that the first human being

31
00:00:51,298 --> 00:00:52,332
who will live 150 years

32
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,167
has already been born.

33
00:00:54,235 --> 00:00:55,802
I believe I am
that human being.

34
00:00:55,853 --> 00:00:59,189
And they brought with them
some disturbing news.

35
00:00:59,273 --> 00:01:00,340
Effective tomorrow morning,

36
00:01:00,407 --> 00:01:01,741
the entire government
will be shut down

37
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:03,142
until further notice.

38
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,211
What will Leslie do next?

39
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:08,481
Will April and Andy
make up and make out?

40
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,450
Find out this season
on <i>Parks and Recreation.</i>

41
00:01:10,517 --> 00:01:12,085
Starting right now.

42
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:21,294
Ron...We're back.

43
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:22,378
Bully.

44
00:01:22,463 --> 00:01:23,930
The bankrupt government
of Pawnee

45
00:01:23,998 --> 00:01:26,299
has been shut down all summer,

46
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:27,634
so it's been three months
of no work,

47
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:30,220
no meetings, no memos,
no late nights, nothing.

48
00:01:30,304 --> 00:01:31,804
I wouldn't wish it
on my worst enemy.

49
00:01:31,872 --> 00:01:33,890
Oh, rounding up the team.

50
00:01:33,974 --> 00:01:35,475
So exciting.

51
00:01:35,542 --> 00:01:38,761
I have goosebumps.
Feel.

52
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:41,447
And that's why they call me
Prince Charming.

53
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:42,749
'Cause I always find
the glass slipper

54
00:01:42,816 --> 00:01:44,067
for my Cinderella.

55
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:45,418
These are way too tight.

56
00:01:45,486 --> 00:01:47,320
Well, the real Cinderella
didn't have hippo feet.

57
00:01:47,387 --> 00:01:48,571
Tom, we're back.

58
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,824
Jeremy!
Suck it!

59
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:53,293
By the way, I've been
giving away free sports bras

60
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,929
to the girls
at hot dog on a stick.

61
00:01:55,996 --> 00:01:57,730
Look, we can dance all day,

62
00:01:57,798 --> 00:01:58,998
but it's time to step up.

63
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:01,367
Are you buying
4,000 rubber nipples from me

64
00:02:01,418 --> 00:02:03,286
or not?

65
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,454
Dee, you have a visitor.

66
00:02:04,538 --> 00:02:05,788
We back?

67
00:02:05,873 --> 00:02:06,906
We're back.

68
00:02:06,957 --> 00:02:07,907
All right.

69
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:12,795
- Jerry.
- Oh, my gosh.

70
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,347
Look who's here.
Leslie.

71
00:02:14,414 --> 00:02:16,266
The nightmare's over, Jerry.
We're going back to work.

72
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,102
You're not gonna need
this anymore.

73
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,804
Come on!

74
00:02:24,692 --> 00:02:27,226
I called shotgun.
Everybody heard me.

75
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:39,864
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

76
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:48,831
Well...

77
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:52,051
I am usually not one
for speeches.

78
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:53,052
So good-bye.

79
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,637
Break's over, mofos.

80
00:02:54,722 --> 00:02:55,722
Okay, here's the situation.

81
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:58,007
We are operating
on a shoestring budget.

82
00:02:58,092 --> 00:03:00,226
Park services
have been slashed.

83
00:03:00,293 --> 00:03:02,512
But we are all still here.

84
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:04,063
And we have a job to do.

85
00:03:04,131 --> 00:03:06,649
Make the world's biggest pizza.

86
00:03:06,734 --> 00:03:08,101
No, make this town fun

87
00:03:08,152 --> 00:03:09,402
for the people who live here.

88
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,403
Fine, but after that,

89
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,821
the pizza is our top priority.

90
00:03:11,905 --> 00:03:13,072
No, it's not.

91
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,657
We're getting pizza?

92
00:03:14,742 --> 00:03:17,994
April, hey.
It's me, Andy.

93
00:03:18,078 --> 00:03:19,479
Dwyer.

94
00:03:19,546 --> 00:03:22,415
Uh, this is, like,
the 200th message I've left you

95
00:03:22,482 --> 00:03:24,050
without a response.

96
00:03:24,118 --> 00:03:25,201
So...

97
00:03:25,285 --> 00:03:27,620
If you're trying
to tell me something,

98
00:03:27,688 --> 00:03:29,422
I do not know what it is

99
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:31,858
because you won't call me back.

100
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:33,893
It is truly great
to see all of you.

101
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:35,428
Huh?

102
00:03:35,496 --> 00:03:36,996
It's great news.

103
00:03:37,064 --> 00:03:39,499
Okay, I have to run.
Ben.

104
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:42,568
The bad news, which...

105
00:03:42,636 --> 00:03:44,871
I get to deliver, is this:

106
00:03:44,938 --> 00:03:46,506
Your only work
for the time being

107
00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:48,841
will be existing
park maintenance.

108
00:03:48,892 --> 00:03:50,009
So that just means

109
00:03:50,077 --> 00:03:51,010
that we're in maintenance mode!

110
00:03:51,078 --> 00:03:52,445
Yeah!

111
00:03:52,513 --> 00:03:54,397
Jerry.

112
00:03:54,481 --> 00:03:56,215
Okay, see, I've spent
the last few months

113
00:03:56,283 --> 00:03:57,233
brainstorming,

114
00:03:57,317 --> 00:03:58,234
and I have
some really great ideas,

115
00:03:58,318 --> 00:03:59,852
and I put them
in my idea binders.

116
00:03:59,903 --> 00:04:01,521
I mean, they're color-coded,
for God's sake.

117
00:04:01,588 --> 00:04:02,622
Okay, actually, yeah.
There is...

118
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,374
There is one thing
that you will be doing.

119
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:05,792
Apparently, in Indiana,

120
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:07,293
if you don't provide
a basketball league,

121
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,711
people get very upset.

122
00:04:08,779 --> 00:04:10,763
And, quite frankly,
throw things at you

123
00:04:10,831 --> 00:04:12,365
and call you names.

124
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:14,267
Like turd boy.
I... whatever.

125
00:04:14,334 --> 00:04:16,502
Point is, I reinstated
youth basketball.

126
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,254
It says here you only have
money for two teams.

127
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:20,590
Yeah, they're gonna develop
a great rivalry.

128
00:04:22,476 --> 00:04:24,177
Under my tutelage,
you will grow

129
00:04:24,228 --> 00:04:25,545
from boys into men.

130
00:04:25,612 --> 00:04:28,147
From men into gladiators.

131
00:04:28,215 --> 00:04:31,401
And from gladiators
into Swansons.

132
00:04:31,485 --> 00:04:33,436
Behold.

133
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,822
The Swanson pyramid
of greatness.

134
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:38,658
I've been developing
the Swanson pyramid of greatness

135
00:04:38,726 --> 00:04:39,759
for years.

136
00:04:39,827 --> 00:04:42,078
It's a perfectly
calibrated recipe

137
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:44,063
for maximum personal
achievement.

138
00:04:44,131 --> 00:04:45,865
Categories include:

139
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:48,117
Capitalism, God's way
of determining

140
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:50,203
who is smart, and who is poor.

141
00:04:50,254 --> 00:04:53,206
Crying, acceptable at funerals

142
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:54,607
and the Grand Canyon.

143
00:04:54,675 --> 00:04:57,143
Rage, poise, property rights.

144
00:04:57,211 --> 00:04:59,262
Fish, for sport only.

145
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:00,513
Not for meat.

146
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:02,298
Fish meat is practically
a vegetable.

147
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:03,299
Haircuts.

148
00:05:03,383 --> 00:05:04,416
There are three
acceptable haircuts.

149
00:05:04,468 --> 00:05:06,085
High and tight,

150
00:05:06,153 --> 00:05:08,488
crew cut, buzz cut.

151
00:05:08,555 --> 00:05:10,923
Are the scissors broken
in your house, son?

152
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:13,126
So you happy
to be back at work?

153
00:05:13,193 --> 00:05:15,194
Well, our budget's
been slashed to zero.

154
00:05:15,262 --> 00:05:16,779
I tried to buy fertilizer
the other day

155
00:05:16,864 --> 00:05:17,930
for the soccer field.

156
00:05:17,998 --> 00:05:19,482
Request denied.

157
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:21,234
We literally can't buy shit.

158
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:23,002
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- No, I mean, look.

159
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,303
When we were kids,

160
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:26,472
the Parks Department
would do these big projects.

161
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,742
Winter Jamboree,
the Harvest Festival.

162
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,878
It's like they don't have faith
in us anymore.

163
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:33,546
I'm not a paper-pusher,
Ann.

164
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:35,047
I need to be out
in the streets,

165
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:36,615
planting trees
and cracking skulls.

166
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:38,518
Leslie Knope.
Ann Perkins.

167
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:40,619
How are my two favorite people
in this entire town?

168
00:05:40,671 --> 00:05:41,838
Not good, Chris.

169
00:05:41,922 --> 00:05:43,289
There's a whole line of people
in my office

170
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,357
complaining that
all their programs

171
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:45,675
have been slashed.

172
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,893
Yeah, I know.
It's terrible.

173
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,896
Is there anything
we can do about that?

174
00:05:49,963 --> 00:05:50,997
- No.
- Damn, sorry, Leslie.

175
00:05:51,064 --> 00:05:52,965
Ann, could I talk to you
for a minute?

176
00:05:56,503 --> 00:05:58,371
- So how's it going?
- Save it, okay?

177
00:05:58,438 --> 00:06:00,406
I know you don't have
faith in me

178
00:06:00,474 --> 00:06:01,741
and my department,
and that's fine.

179
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:03,042
But don't expect me to sit here

180
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,410
and chit-chat with you.

181
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:06,045
All right, fair enough.

182
00:06:06,113 --> 00:06:07,180
Go the other way.

183
00:06:07,247 --> 00:06:09,348
But I'm just going to that...

184
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,917
All right, uh...

185
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:12,919
Look, I'm very flattered.

186
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:13,920
But again, I don't think

187
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:15,588
I should go out with you.

188
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:17,156
Can I ask you why not?

189
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:18,324
Because I thought
we had a great time

190
00:06:18,392 --> 00:06:20,493
the night you got drunk
and kissed me.

191
00:06:20,561 --> 00:06:22,929
And you did use your tongue.

192
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:24,764
I just don't think
I'm in a place

193
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:26,699
to go out with anyone
right now.

194
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:28,167
Okay, well,

195
00:06:28,218 --> 00:06:29,185
if you change your mind,

196
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:30,720
you know where
to find me, Ann Perkins.

197
00:06:30,804 --> 00:06:32,338
Leslie Knope.

198
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:34,307
Yes.
Did he ask you out again?

199
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:36,192
He did, he did.

200
00:06:36,276 --> 00:06:38,394
He is nothing
if not persistent.

201
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:40,146
And hot.

202
00:06:40,197 --> 00:06:42,215
He's ver...
he's pretty hot.

203
00:06:42,282 --> 00:06:43,232
Yeah, he's hot.

204
00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:44,400
But he's intense.

205
00:06:44,484 --> 00:06:45,785
But he's really, really hot.

206
00:06:45,853 --> 00:06:46,903
But he's your boss.

207
00:06:46,987 --> 00:06:48,454
Oh, my God,
I just thought of an idea

208
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:49,855
of how we can save
the Parks Department.

209
00:06:49,907 --> 00:06:51,190
Great.

210
00:06:51,241 --> 00:06:52,291
Let me ask you one question.

211
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:54,126
Would you be cool doing things

212
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:55,194
that a prostitute does?

213
00:06:55,262 --> 00:06:56,963
Uh...

214
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,197
Minus the money.

215
00:06:58,265 --> 00:07:00,416
Definitely yes, then.

216
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,601
Thanks, Ann.

217
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:03,586
Looking sharp.
Beautiful.

218
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,471
The backboard is your friend.

219
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,774
Aaaa, bam!

220
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:10,142
Boom!

221
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,929
I'd say my coaching style
is centered

222
00:07:13,013 --> 00:07:14,247
around fundamentals,

223
00:07:14,314 --> 00:07:15,481
with an emphasis on fun.

224
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:17,233
Hey, watch this.

225
00:07:17,317 --> 00:07:18,901
Go get it!

226
00:07:18,986 --> 00:07:22,421
And a second emphasis
on mental.

227
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:24,156
Yeah, it can be hard work,

228
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:25,157
but every time I look

229
00:07:25,225 --> 00:07:26,893
one of these kids in the eyes

230
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,395
and he calls me coach...

231
00:07:29,446 --> 00:07:32,615
That's how I know
I agreed to be a coach.

232
00:07:32,683 --> 00:07:34,233
Mouse rat!

233
00:07:34,284 --> 00:07:36,669
Carnage!

234
00:07:36,736 --> 00:07:38,254
Okay, gentlemen, it's time

235
00:07:38,338 --> 00:07:40,406
for the pregame coin toss.

236
00:07:40,457 --> 00:07:42,241
There's no coin toss
in basketball.

237
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:43,626
Are those women's sneakers?

238
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,411
Yes, they are, Ron.
You know what?

239
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,964
They fit better.
I got an employee discount.

240
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:48,981
And the best part is,

241
00:07:49,049 --> 00:07:50,349
no one can tell.

242
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:52,251
All right, let's do this.

243
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,254
Match point,
touchdown, et cetera.

244
00:07:57,257 --> 00:07:59,108
Yeah, go my team.
All right.

245
00:07:59,176 --> 00:08:00,526
Okay, I like
what you're wearing,

246
00:08:00,593 --> 00:08:02,528
but I need it to be
300% sexier.

247
00:08:02,596 --> 00:08:03,763
Do you have any of those shirts

248
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,698
that look wet all the time?

249
00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:06,933
Or... or, like,
a metal bikini?

250
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,567
Oh, you know what's
always sexy?

251
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:10,102
Fingerless gloves.

252
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,205
What about if I wear
this normal, sane outfit?

253
00:08:13,273 --> 00:08:14,273
Yeah, okay,
but you're gonna have to eat

254
00:08:14,341 --> 00:08:15,958
something sexy, then,
like a banana.

255
00:08:16,043 --> 00:08:17,159
For dinner?

256
00:08:17,244 --> 00:08:18,244
Well, what's sexy food?

257
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:19,545
Asparagus?

258
00:08:19,612 --> 00:08:20,830
No, you know what's sexy?

259
00:08:20,914 --> 00:08:22,748
Turkey chili.

260
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:24,283
- Mmm.
- Yum.

261
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:25,751
And how, exactly,

262
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:28,821
am I supposed to casually steer
the conversation

263
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:30,623
towards the Parks
Department budget?

264
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:31,991
Okay, it's totally easy.

265
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,859
Tell you what.
You be Chris.

266
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:35,594
I'll be you.
I'll show you how it's done.

267
00:08:35,646 --> 00:08:36,812
Okay.

268
00:08:36,897 --> 00:08:38,030
Ann Perkins.

269
00:08:38,098 --> 00:08:39,565
You are wonderful and amazing,

270
00:08:39,633 --> 00:08:40,967
and I'm happy
to be here with you.

271
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:41,968
Thank you, Chris.

272
00:08:42,035 --> 00:08:44,203
I'm wearing a tuxedo vest

273
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:46,155
with no shirt on underneath.

274
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:47,306
Uh-oh.

275
00:08:47,374 --> 00:08:48,507
Can I get you a drink?

276
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:50,526
I love every single beverage
in the world.

277
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,078
I would like some wine.

278
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:54,914
And, oops, my vest popped open.

279
00:08:54,982 --> 00:08:57,750
Just like the budget
needs to pop open,

280
00:08:57,818 --> 00:08:59,885
and you need to pour it

281
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:01,854
into my Parks Department.

282
00:09:01,922 --> 00:09:03,522
Great.

283
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,625
I am so excited
that you finally agreed

284
00:09:06,677 --> 00:09:07,994
to go out with me.

285
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:09,762
What a magnificent
flip-flop.

286
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,332
You're a magnificent
asker-outer.

287
00:09:13,383 --> 00:09:15,868
Tell me every single detail
of your day.

288
00:09:15,936 --> 00:09:17,570
I love dates.

289
00:09:17,637 --> 00:09:19,171
I love connecting with someone.

290
00:09:19,222 --> 00:09:20,940
I love engaging them.

291
00:09:21,008 --> 00:09:23,042
I love being surprised by them.

292
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,543
I have never had a bad date.

293
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:27,246
They've all been either great
or phenomenally great.

294
00:09:27,314 --> 00:09:29,615
Nurses are the most
undervalued members

295
00:09:29,683 --> 00:09:31,350
of our society by far.

296
00:09:31,418 --> 00:09:33,619
I think all of you
should make as much money

297
00:09:33,687 --> 00:09:34,620
as the CEO of Google.

298
00:09:34,688 --> 00:09:38,090
Wow, thank you.
I agree.

299
00:09:38,158 --> 00:09:39,709
Can I ask you a question?

300
00:09:39,793 --> 00:09:41,027
Why am I so positive
all the time?

301
00:09:41,094 --> 00:09:45,131
Yes, that's exactly
the question.

302
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:47,099
I was born
with a blood disorder.

303
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:48,534
And my parents were told

304
00:09:48,585 --> 00:09:50,202
that I had three weeks to live.

305
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,204
And here I still am,

306
00:09:52,255 --> 00:09:55,541
some 2,000-odd weeks later.

307
00:09:55,592 --> 00:10:01,180
And I have enjoyed
every one of them.

308
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:02,681
I think it's going well.

309
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:05,017
He's actually
a really nice guy.

310
00:10:05,085 --> 00:10:06,268
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

311
00:10:06,353 --> 00:10:07,520
Okay, so have you asked him
yet about the money?

312
00:10:07,571 --> 00:10:08,771
Well, it's a date, you know?

313
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:10,089
It's kind of hard
to casually bring up

314
00:10:10,157 --> 00:10:11,257
the Parks budget
when you're talking

315
00:10:11,324 --> 00:10:12,441
about your favorite movies.

316
00:10:12,526 --> 00:10:15,745
<i>Jurassic Park,</i>
parks are so great,

317
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:17,029
the Parks Department
needs money.

318
00:10:17,097 --> 00:10:18,247
I just did it in three moves.

319
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:19,331
Well, then, why don't you
just come here

320
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,332
and do it yourself?

321
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,534
- Okay.
- Holy crap.

322
00:10:22,626 --> 00:10:25,493
What? Chris and Ann?
What are you two doing here?

323
00:10:25,512 --> 00:10:26,529
We are on a date.

324
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:28,630
And it is going phenomenally.

325
00:10:28,714 --> 00:10:30,214
Thanks, but I'll stay
for just one drink.

326
00:10:30,266 --> 00:10:32,183
I'm so happy I ran into you

327
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:33,751
because I wanted
to speak to you...

328
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:36,220
- Well, well, well.
- Ben.

329
00:10:36,272 --> 00:10:38,306
- What a fun surprise.
- Oh, that's right.

330
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,058
You were coming here tonight
on a date.

331
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,126
And, hey, Leslie is joining you

332
00:10:42,194 --> 00:10:44,445
on this wonderfully
romantic occasion.

333
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,863
How 'bout that?

334
00:10:45,931 --> 00:10:47,532
- Fantastic.
- It is.

335
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:48,866
Can I talk to you?

336
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:50,201
- Sure.
- What are you doing here?

337
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:51,703
I'm just confirming
a suspicion I had, Leslie.

338
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:52,837
What are you talking about?

339
00:10:52,905 --> 00:10:54,155
I had nothing to do
with this date.

340
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:55,373
- Uh-huh.
- They're both so beautiful.

341
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,841
They probably just want
to see each other naked.

342
00:10:56,909 --> 00:10:58,276
Okay, well, I know
what you're trying to do.

343
00:10:58,344 --> 00:10:59,644
And you're not that good
at being sneaky.

344
00:10:59,712 --> 00:11:01,462
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

345
00:11:01,547 --> 00:11:03,064
- I'm great at being sneaky.
- Clearly you're not.

346
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:04,215
Hey, you guys.

347
00:11:04,283 --> 00:11:06,250
Let's all have dinner together.

348
00:11:06,318 --> 00:11:07,685
The more the merrier.

349
00:11:07,753 --> 00:11:09,687
- Great.
- Great.

350
00:11:09,755 --> 00:11:11,689
Good job, guys.
Yep.

351
00:11:11,757 --> 00:11:12,790
All right, Eric, taking a rest,

352
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:14,092
or are you hurt?

353
00:11:14,143 --> 00:11:16,010
Taking a rest?

354
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,428
Smart.

355
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:18,479
Destroy them, gentlemen.

356
00:11:18,564 --> 00:11:21,632
Feel no sympathy.

357
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,570
Yes, Ron Swanson is dating
my ex-wife, Wendy.

358
00:11:25,637 --> 00:11:27,572
Big deal.

359
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:28,573
My girlfriend, Lucy,

360
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,074
is the sexiest woman in town.

361
00:11:30,142 --> 00:11:31,676
She's Cuban, she's got tattoos,

362
00:11:31,744 --> 00:11:33,044
and she's into me,

363
00:11:33,112 --> 00:11:34,362
which, as far as I'm concerned,

364
00:11:34,446 --> 00:11:37,115
is the sexiest quality
a woman can have.

365
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,316
Oh, I have an idea.

366
00:11:38,384 --> 00:11:40,051
You know what would be
really fun after dinner?

367
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:42,253
We should take a walk
by the pond in Ramsett Park.

368
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,855
Walking in parks can be
very romantic.

369
00:11:43,922 --> 00:11:45,923
Yeah, too bad the park's
always closed, though.

370
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:47,859
Okay, well,
you two are on a date.

371
00:11:47,926 --> 00:11:52,180
So Leslie and I
should probably get going.

372
00:11:52,264 --> 00:11:54,015
Uh, well, I'm actually
having a good time

373
00:11:54,099 --> 00:11:55,016
with everyone.

374
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,718
Chris?

375
00:11:56,802 --> 00:11:58,369
Oh, me, too.
I'm having a fantastic time.

376
00:11:58,437 --> 00:11:59,370
What do you say we take
this whole

377
00:11:59,438 --> 00:12:00,872
date-plus-two-
other-people thing

378
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:02,056

384
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:12,066
Great call, Leslie Knope.

385
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:13,084
Thanks.

386
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:15,720
Look, even Ben's dancing.

387
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,323
That's the way
to shoot the ball, Chignoli.

388
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,324
Hustle back.

389
00:12:24,963 --> 00:12:26,764
Uh...

390
00:12:26,832 --> 00:12:27,899
It's a foul.

391
00:12:27,966 --> 00:12:29,584
What?
On whom?

392
00:12:29,668 --> 00:12:30,618
Your team.

393
00:12:30,686 --> 00:12:32,737
Number 50.
He was double dribbling.

394
00:12:32,805 --> 00:12:33,738
He's on defense.

395
00:12:33,806 --> 00:12:35,623
Exactly.

396
00:12:35,691 --> 00:12:36,908
It's a technical difficulty,
so that means

397
00:12:36,975 --> 00:12:38,559
Andy's team throws the ball

398
00:12:38,644 --> 00:12:39,710
from the stripey thing.

399
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:40,728
Let's go.

400
00:12:40,813 --> 00:12:42,597
The stripey thing?

♪ ♪

402
00:12:49,354 --> 00:12:50,938
Hey, there.

403
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:52,556
How's it going?

404
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:54,592
Great, thanks.

405
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,576
Can I buy you a drink?

406
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:58,329
Oh, I'm very flattered,

407
00:12:58,396 --> 00:13:00,281
but this is my
stunningly gorgeous date,

408
00:13:00,365 --> 00:13:01,299
Ann Perkins.

409
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:03,134
Oh, hi.

410
00:13:03,202 --> 00:13:05,086
- Hi.
- Sorry.

411
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,537
Oh, no problem.

412
00:13:06,588 --> 00:13:08,623
In fact, let me buy
all of you a drink

413
00:13:08,707 --> 00:13:09,957
for being so welcoming today.

414
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:11,092
Waiter.

415
00:13:11,176 --> 00:13:16,481
I think I may
actually like Chris.

416
00:13:16,548 --> 00:13:17,682
On the house, Leslie.

417
00:13:17,749 --> 00:13:19,967
Oh, thank you.

418
00:13:20,052 --> 00:13:21,953
I'm sort of a gay hero.

419
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,755
Last year, I married
two penguins at the zoo,

420
00:13:24,823 --> 00:13:25,957
and it turned out
they were both gay.

421
00:13:26,024 --> 00:13:27,525
- Penguin wedding.
- Mm-hmm.

422
00:13:27,592 --> 00:13:30,311
- That's cute.
- It was so cute.

423
00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:31,562
But enough about how
cute it was.

424
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,864
Why don't you think
I should have the money?

425
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:34,599
Good lord, really?

426
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:35,950
Look.

427
00:13:36,034 --> 00:13:37,168
When I was 18,

428
00:13:37,236 --> 00:13:40,171
and I became mayor
of my hometown,

429
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,839
I used every last dollar we had

430
00:13:41,907 --> 00:13:44,108
to open a giant
winter sports complex.

431
00:13:44,176 --> 00:13:45,376
Called it Icetown.

432
00:13:45,444 --> 00:13:46,811
And it turned out great,
and everyone loved it.

433
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,812
Uh, yeah, kinda.

434
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,180
It was never completed,

435
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:51,382
and I got impeached.

436
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,517
Newspaper headline was,

437
00:13:52,584 --> 00:13:55,853
"Icetown costs ice clown
his town crown."

438
00:13:55,921 --> 00:13:56,888
Yuck.

439
00:13:56,955 --> 00:13:58,823
They were big into rhymes.

440
00:13:58,891 --> 00:14:00,424
Well, I don't know.

441
00:14:00,476 --> 00:14:01,659
I think Icetown sounds great.

442
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,960
And the point is,

443
00:14:03,028 --> 00:14:05,513
at least you tried something.

444
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:08,983
Foul!

445
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:10,318
Foul on number three

446
00:14:10,402 --> 00:14:12,019
for taking a number two
on number four.

447
00:14:14,406 --> 00:14:15,472
Roughing the passer.

448
00:14:15,524 --> 00:14:16,991
Double dribbling.
That's a foul.

449
00:14:17,075 --> 00:14:19,076
That's a foul for touching
the basketball.

450
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:20,244
What are you gonna do about it?

451
00:14:20,312 --> 00:14:21,412
Nothing.
You fouled.

452
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:22,547
You can't do anything.

453
00:14:22,614 --> 00:14:24,165
Okay.

454
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:25,366
You're ejected.
You're ejected.

455
00:14:26,985 --> 00:14:28,920
Oh, what's the matter
there, Ron?

456
00:14:28,987 --> 00:14:29,921
No players left?

457
00:14:29,988 --> 00:14:32,657
Yay, Andy's team!

458
00:14:32,724 --> 00:14:34,325
- Look at 'em go!
- Come on.

459
00:14:34,376 --> 00:14:36,511
Now you're openly
cheering for the other team?

460
00:14:36,578 --> 00:14:38,262
- Put my boys back in.
- You made me the ref.

461
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,347
Deal with it.

462
00:14:39,431 --> 00:14:40,698
You know what?
Take this uniform off.

463
00:14:40,766 --> 00:14:42,667
- Hey, hey.
- You don't deserve to wear it.

464
00:14:43,969 --> 00:14:45,736
Ron's ejected
for molesting the ref.

465
00:14:45,804 --> 00:14:46,837
Oh, yeah?
I'm ejected?

466
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:47,855
- Yes, you are.
- Tom, what are you doing?

467
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,173
I'm ejecting you.

468
00:14:49,224 --> 00:14:50,841
You're ejected, too.
Everyone's ejected.

469
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:51,842
Oh, yeah?
She's ejected?

470
00:14:51,894 --> 00:14:52,843
Yeah.

471
00:14:52,895 --> 00:14:57,532
Rrrraaaagh!

472
00:14:57,616 --> 00:14:59,584
Go ahead, go.

473
00:14:59,651 --> 00:15:01,619
Well, that's a forfeit.
Andy's team wins.

474
00:15:01,687 --> 00:15:02,787
No way!

475
00:15:02,854 --> 00:15:05,072
We won!
Oh, man!

476
00:15:05,157 --> 00:15:06,924
Eat it!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

477
00:15:06,992 --> 00:15:09,427
Andy, Andy, Andy!

478
00:15:09,494 --> 00:15:11,546
Yeah!

479
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,798
Ah-ha-ha!
Yes!

480
00:15:13,865 --> 00:15:15,733
I dedicate this victory
to April Ludgate.

481
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:16,734
It feels good.

482
00:15:16,802 --> 00:15:19,337
And it feels sticky.

483
00:15:19,404 --> 00:15:21,088
From the Gatorade.

484
00:15:21,156 --> 00:15:22,840
We're barely able to function.

485
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:25,142
We could really use that money.

486
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,677
But you know,
I don't know if it's because

487
00:15:26,745 --> 00:15:28,212
I'm in such a good mood,

488
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,614
or because of the charming
Ann Perkins,

489
00:15:29,681 --> 00:15:31,515
but I am going
to seriously consider that.

490
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,517
Really?
That's great.

491
00:15:33,585 --> 00:15:34,518
Mission accomplished.

492
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,753
Let's boogie.

493
00:15:35,821 --> 00:15:36,954
Mission accomplished?

494
00:15:37,022 --> 00:15:40,191
Uh-oh.

495
00:15:40,242 --> 00:15:41,425
Yeah.

496
00:15:41,493 --> 00:15:45,363
There's a mission, uh,
that Ann had thought of.

497
00:15:45,414 --> 00:15:46,397
It was both of our ideas,

498
00:15:46,465 --> 00:15:47,765
but it was mostly Ann's.

499
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,951
We...

500
00:15:50,035 --> 00:15:51,953
I had mentioned to Ann
that it would be fun

501
00:15:52,037 --> 00:15:53,404
if you two went on a date.

502
00:15:53,472 --> 00:15:54,505
So then...

503
00:15:54,573 --> 00:15:57,258
You could, uh,
talk about the money

504
00:15:57,342 --> 00:16:01,512
and then, you know,
maybe give it to me.

505
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:04,215
Wow.

506
00:16:04,283 --> 00:16:08,286
I've just had
my first bad date.

507
00:16:08,353 --> 00:16:10,388
Ann Perkins.

508
00:16:13,091 --> 00:16:16,127
Not that sneaky.

509
00:16:24,978 --> 00:16:26,345
April!

510
00:16:29,116 --> 00:16:30,032
April.

511
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,650
Where have you been?
Oh, my God.

512
00:16:31,702 --> 00:16:33,486
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm okay.

513
00:16:33,553 --> 00:16:34,653
I'm dying to see you.

514
00:16:34,705 --> 00:16:37,773
I called and texted you,
like, a billion times.

515
00:16:37,841 --> 00:16:40,226
Oh, I'm sorry.

516
00:16:40,293 --> 00:16:41,260
I was in Venezuela.

517
00:16:41,328 --> 00:16:43,162
Oh, really?

518
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,330
Wow.

519
00:16:44,381 --> 00:16:46,749
Across the pond.

520
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,267
Wow.

521
00:16:48,335 --> 00:16:49,435
I thought maybe
I woulda heard from you

522
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:53,055
at least once
because of what happened.

523
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,473
Ann kissing me?
I'm so sorry about that.

524
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:55,591
It was so stupid,

525
00:16:55,675 --> 00:16:57,410
and it meant nothing.

526
00:16:57,477 --> 00:17:00,563
I wouldn't worry about it.
It's totally fine.

527
00:17:00,647 --> 00:17:02,064
Hey.

528
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:04,817
This is my boyfriend, Eduardo.

529
00:17:04,885 --> 00:17:06,185
No, it's not.

530
00:17:06,253 --> 00:17:08,687
- <i>¿Listo para lonche?</i>
<i>- Si.</i>

531
00:17:08,739 --> 00:17:10,256
That means we're going
to lunch.

532
00:17:10,323 --> 00:17:12,024
How do you say
have a great time,

533
00:17:12,075 --> 00:17:13,025
don't choke on anything?

534
00:17:13,076 --> 00:17:14,193
Bye.

535
00:17:17,998 --> 00:17:19,865
Leslie asked me
to do her a favor,

536
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,868
and I love her, so I did it.

537
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,371
I'm sorry, and I'm here
to eat crow.

538
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,872
I like you a lot.

539
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,908
Let's go out again.

540
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:34,680
Ann Perkins.

541
00:17:34,748 --> 00:17:37,099
Budget solution number 28.

542
00:17:37,184 --> 00:17:41,937
Use grazing sheep
to mow grass in parks.

543
00:17:42,022 --> 00:17:45,858
Note: Tired sheep
could become food

544
00:17:45,926 --> 00:17:47,393
or sweaters.

545
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,297
Well, I got my answer.

546
00:17:51,364 --> 00:17:52,665
About April.

547
00:17:52,732 --> 00:17:54,033
She hates me.
Yeah.

548
00:17:54,101 --> 00:17:56,101
And she got a boyfriend,
I guess,

549
00:17:56,153 --> 00:17:57,570
from some city in Mexico.

550
00:17:57,637 --> 00:17:59,271
So...

551
00:17:59,322 --> 00:18:01,307
What do I do?

552
00:18:01,374 --> 00:18:02,541
Okay.

553
00:18:02,609 --> 00:18:04,310
Well, when your back's
against the wall

554
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:07,413
and odds are stacked
against you,

555
00:18:07,481 --> 00:18:09,281
you just...
you...

556
00:18:09,332 --> 00:18:11,117
You swing the hardest, damn it.

557
00:18:11,184 --> 00:18:12,468
You go big, or you go home.

558
00:18:12,552 --> 00:18:14,753
And you don't seem like
the kind of guy who goes home.

559
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:16,255
I'm not.

560
00:18:16,306 --> 00:18:17,389
I don't even really
have a home.

561
00:18:17,457 --> 00:18:18,891
- Go get her, Andy!
- Okay.

562
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,093
Okay, thanks, Leslie!

563
00:18:24,231 --> 00:18:26,432
Okay, so we know the people
who run this government

564
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
have no faith in us.

565
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:28,967
My plan is gonna change that

566
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:30,503
and bring the budget back.

567
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,837
And the answer's been
right in front of us

568
00:18:31,905 --> 00:18:32,822
the whole time.

569
00:18:32,906 --> 00:18:34,857
Ew, check your testicles?

570
00:18:34,941 --> 00:18:35,908
No, not that.

571
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:37,409
Although that is
very good advice.

572
00:18:37,477 --> 00:18:38,410
I'm looking at you, Jerry.

573
00:18:38,478 --> 00:18:39,678
No, what's gonna save us

574
00:18:39,746 --> 00:18:43,249
is right there.

575
00:18:43,316 --> 00:18:44,850
Gentlemen, I realize
that times are tough,

576
00:18:44,918 --> 00:18:46,585
and the budget is tight.

577
00:18:46,653 --> 00:18:49,455
But if the people of this town
have nothing else to do

578
00:18:49,523 --> 00:18:52,191
but sit in their houses
and play video games,

579
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:54,493
then Pawnee will die.

580
00:18:54,561 --> 00:18:57,763
And we refuse
to let that happen.

581
00:18:57,831 --> 00:18:59,882
Now.

582
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,051
This town was historically
known for two things.

583
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,271
Widespread obesity

584
00:19:05,338 --> 00:19:09,058
and the annual
Pawnee Harvest Festival.

585
00:19:09,142 --> 00:19:10,910
People from all over Indiana
would come

586
00:19:10,977 --> 00:19:12,244
and gaze in wonderment

587
00:19:12,312 --> 00:19:13,812
at how fat our citizens were.

588
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,030
And while they were here,

589
00:19:15,115 --> 00:19:16,582
they would also attend
the festival.

590
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,051
A full week of corn mazes,

591
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:20,870
hayrides, ferris wheels,

592
00:19:20,954 --> 00:19:22,821
pumpkins the size of jeeps.

593
00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:25,858
We lost that festival
a few years ago,

594
00:19:25,926 --> 00:19:27,393
due to another round
of budget cuts.

595
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,763
And I propose
we bring the festival back.

596
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,698
With ticket sales
and corporate sponsorship,

597
00:19:32,749 --> 00:19:33,999
we'll earn all that money back.

598
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:35,334
And believe me,
people will come.

599
00:19:35,402 --> 00:19:36,835
What if they don't?

600
00:19:36,903 --> 00:19:39,805
Well...

601
00:19:39,872 --> 00:19:42,141
Then you eliminate
the Parks Department.

602
00:19:42,209 --> 00:19:44,777
And you guys are all
on board with this.

603
00:19:44,844 --> 00:19:46,412
- Aye.
- Yes.

604
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:48,614
Look, we're not
just pencil pushers.

605
00:19:48,682 --> 00:19:51,817
We are a reflection
of the community.

606
00:19:51,884 --> 00:19:55,321
And we believe that we can
strengthen that community.

607
00:19:55,388 --> 00:19:57,323
Because in the end,

608
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,025
the reason why we're all here

609
00:20:00,093 --> 00:20:02,828
is to bring people together.

610
00:20:02,896 --> 00:20:06,032
♪ ♪

611
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,375
That...

612
00:20:07,443 --> 00:20:09,544
Literally...

613
00:20:09,612 --> 00:20:12,814
Is the most moving thing
I've ever heard.

614
00:20:12,882 --> 00:20:16,985
And a good idea.

615
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:17,986
Yeah, all right.

616
00:20:18,037 --> 00:20:19,320
Excellent.

617
00:20:19,388 --> 00:20:21,406
Great, okay, so everybody,

618
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,857
we're gonna party hard
for 15 minutes.

619
00:20:22,908 --> 00:20:26,327
Then we're gonna have
our first brainstorming session.

620
00:20:30,956 --> 00:20:31,956
Hello, April.

621
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:34,124
Do you like the flowers?

622
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:35,543
What are you doing?

623
00:20:35,627 --> 00:20:37,361
All due respect, Eduardo.

624
00:20:37,412 --> 00:20:38,829
You seem like a great guy.

625
00:20:38,897 --> 00:20:40,564
But I like April,
and I'm coming after her

626
00:20:40,632 --> 00:20:42,616
with everything I've got.

627
00:20:42,684 --> 00:20:44,602
So do you want
to go out with me?

628
00:20:44,669 --> 00:20:47,688
No.

629
00:20:47,772 --> 00:20:48,906
I thought you were gonna
say yes,

630
00:20:48,974 --> 00:20:49,974
but that's okay.

631
00:20:50,091 --> 00:20:51,859
Because I'll be back tomorrow
to ask you again.

632
00:20:51,927 --> 00:20:53,761
And again the next day.

633
00:20:53,829 --> 00:20:54,945
And the next day.

634
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,946
Not Friday.

635
00:20:56,031 --> 00:20:57,064
I have to go visit my cousin.

636
00:20:57,115 --> 00:20:58,616
But I will be back after that

637
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,101
to ask you again.

638
00:21:00,168 --> 00:21:02,169
[...]

639
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:07,357

Ah! You should do it.

642
00:21:12,748 --> 00:21:14,615
Uh, follow you dream.

643
00:21:14,683 --> 00:21:16,817
Oh, my God.
Really?

644
00:21:16,885 --> 00:21:17,818
That's awesome.

645
00:21:18,953 --> 00:21:21,088
I'll see you tomorrow.
